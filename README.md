# Blood-Donation
This project is to predict whether a blood donor will donate blood in March 2007 based on their past donation behavior. By analyzing historical donation data, this project builds and evaluates machine learning classification models to identify potential donors in advance, helping blood banks plan and manage blood supply more effectively.
